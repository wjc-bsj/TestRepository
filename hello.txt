Crank Storyboard 7.0

New Features and Functionality

Storyboard Designer
-------------------

* You can now select locked components in the
editor.

* Improved UI for glyph selecting in the resource
export configuration editor.

* There is now a data transform action that allows
for transforms to be applied to event data.

* A export prefix and postfix can now be applied
globally and per individual resource in the C
header export.

* Wrapping is now available for scrolling layers
and tables.

* The dither option for RGB565 now uses an algorithm
based on the Floyd Steinberg algorithm.

* There is now a gradient render extension availble.

* A render extension can now be applied to a control
to act as a mask for that control.

* An SVG can now be use as an image in Designer.
This SVG will be rasterized on export to the sizes
that are being used in the UI. 

* Direct editing of text has been improved to use
the same font and size for the direct editing
interface.

* The header file export process now takes a lot
less time to complete.

* The events gre.screendump.complete and
gre.redraw_complete have been added to the list
of selectable events in Designer.

* The Lua API for dumping font resources has been
modified so that it can dump all the resources
for a font file without needing to specify a font
size. 

* Allow and editor style resizing of table cells
similar to what other tools with tables allow.

* Storyboard color picker UI has been enhanced.

* The screen dump action now allows you to specify
a region of the screen to be dumped to a screen
dump image.

* The C header exporter now has an option to
specify the image stride alignment when exporting
images in direct draw mode.

* The C header exporter now has an option for
exporting Direct RGB8888 images with premultiplied
alpha. This is only supported with the VGLite
render manager. 

* A new "Screen Drag" screen transition has been
added.

* The C header export will now perform a smart export
of images based on what the global value is. If the
global value is set to RGB565 for example, the C header
export will export any images that have alpha as
Direct RLE8888 or Direct 8888 based on which is smaller.

* The palette is now themed correctly when using
the dark theme.

* There is now a toggle action that will toggle a
data variable from one value to another without
the need for going to Lua.

* The table padding labels now update based on
whether the horizontal or vertical option is checked.

* The error messages for the PSD import process have
been expanded to include more details about why a
PSD failed to import.

* The variable list in the render extension
properties has been removed.  

Storyboard Engine

* There is now an API to cancel screen transitions.

* The loading of mapargs in Lua calls is deferred

* Storyboard engine now supports the rendering of
color emoji's that are stored in TTF files as bitmaps. 

* The gre.redraw event now has an event payload

* System and performance logging now use a high

* Scrolling will now accelerate when consecutive

* The logging now works with the slog2 application
on QNX platforms.

* There is now a Lua API to check animation state
and it will report one of  progress, paused, stopped,
or complete.

an animation to particular points in the animation

be passed to GL shaders.

Windows OpenGL render manager against was updated to
version 2019r2

* The Android runtime libraries now have a DT_SONAME,
which removes the warning that was generated when
using an Android API greater than version 23.

* The total amount of time that it takes to load
Lua files is reported in
